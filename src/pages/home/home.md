  Hey, Iâ€™m a freelance filmmaker based in Luxembourg. After my film and
  television studies in the field of directing at the Macromedia University of
  Applied Sciences in Cologne, I decided to work as an independent filmmaker in
  Luxembourg. During this period I developed my passion for full-video and
  storytelling.


  For my screen-play I take inspiration from books and observation of everyday life. My fascination for moving images and image composition leads me to find not only the enthusiasm as director but moreover as a cinematographer. Furthermore I [realize clips](/projects/) for events and corporate videos for institutions. As a passionate surfer and surfskater I also try to unify the essence of arts and sport through my travels.
