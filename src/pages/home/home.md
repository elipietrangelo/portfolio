aboutText: >-
  Hey, I am a freelance filmmaker. I studied directing film and television at
  the Macromedia University of Applied Sciences in Cologne, Germany. 


  My fascination for full-video and storytelling heightened since then. Moving images and image composition boost my enthusiasm as a director and more over as a cinematographer. 


  I realize less for events and corporate videos for institutions. For the screenplay I find inspiring subjects in books and with everyday life observation. 


  Beneath, I am a passionate surfer and surfskater. Traveling gives me the opportunity to sublimate the essence of sports, nature and visual art.
