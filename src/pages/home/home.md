aboutText: "Hey, Iâ€™m a freelance filmmaker based in Luxembourg. After my film and television
            studies in the field of directing at the Macromedia University of Applied Sciences in
            Cologne, I decided to work as an independent filmmaker in Luxembourg. During this
            period I developed my passion for full-video and storytelling. For my screen-play I take
            inspiration from books and observation of everyday life.
            My fascination for moving images and image composition leads me to find not only the
            enthusiasm as director but moreover as a cinematographer.
            Furthermore I realize clips for events and corporate videos for institutions.
            As a passionate surfer and surfskater I also try to unify the essence of arts and sport
            through my travels."
